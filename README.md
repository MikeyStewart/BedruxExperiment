# BedruxExperiment

### What?
This is an experiemnt to understand how feasible it is to build (well, maybe 'define') UI from a backend service. This means you can deploy significant changes to your UI, and even run experiemnts and A/B tests, instantly with an API or service like Firebase. This particular app is entirely defined in a JSON however you could do this at a screen level.

### Why?
One of the most significant limitations of mobile development is the play/app store process - specifically the review process and version uptake. The review process can take a while and sometimes your new build may be declined and require a change to contact support. Once your new build is released, it usually takes a while for your users to update their app. In my experience, it usually takes up to two weeks for 90% to have your new version.
